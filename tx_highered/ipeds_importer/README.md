The purpose of this is to make it easier to interact with the [IPEDS Data Center](nces.ed.gov/ipeds/datacenter/Default.aspx)

If you've built your variables in the report builder, you'll find that your reports are limited to 250 variables. This can be a problem because just getting a report with test scores will take up 207 variables. Juggling the MVL files to upload reports can be a pain, but that's still easier than dealing with creating a new set of variables.
