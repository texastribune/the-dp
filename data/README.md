Intro

The data required is gathered from multiple sources.


ICUT
----
The [Independent Colleges and Universities of Texas, Inc.][ICUT] is an
association of privates institutions in Texas. They don't have a repeatable way
of getting data, and the data does is just a series of Excel sheets without any
identifiers. Skimming through the data we did get from ICUT showed that it was
similar (or the same) as the information we could get from IPEDS.

IPEDS
-----

The good thing about IPEDS is that it has a ton of information. You just have
to know how to get it out.

For a good introduction to IPEDS and what kind of data you'll find in there,
you should read this document:

For an overview of the intricacies of pulling data required for this project,
you should read:

THECB
-----

The Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board is the best resource for getting
information about public institutions. Unfortunately, the data is scattered and
reported in multiple formats across multiple systems:

### Almanac

### Accountability

### PREP
